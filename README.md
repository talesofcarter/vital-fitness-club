## ‚öõÔ∏è React Concepts Applied  
This project utilizes several important React concepts to build a dynamic and efficient user interface:  

1. **Passing State as Props**:  
   - State is managed in a parent component and passed to child components as props to maintain a single source of truth.  
   - Example: Managing form inputs or toggling UI elements.  

2. **Conditional Rendering**:  
   - UI elements are rendered based on specific conditions.  
   - Example: Displaying error messages or success notifications only when certain criteria are met.  

3. **Handling onChange Events**:  
   - The `onChange` handler is used to capture user input in real-time and update the component state dynamically.  
   - Example: Updating the form state as users type in the input fields.  

These concepts contribute to creating a robust, scalable, and maintainable React application.
